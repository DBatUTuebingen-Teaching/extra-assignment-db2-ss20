(#) MonetDB and MAL [4 + 4 = 8 Points]

Use the DDL and DML statements in the provided file `mal.sql` to set up
two tables `master(a,b,c)` and `detail(a,b,c)` inside a MonetDB
database.  (You will find that these tables are in a simple 1:10
relationship.)

The SQL query _Q1_ below refers to both tables:

~~~sql
-- Query Q1
SELECT m.*
FROM   master AS m
WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 1
               FROM   detail AS d
               WHERE  m.c = d.c
               AND    d.b >= 'a');
~~~

**YOUR TASKS:**

**Add all answers to one plain-text file `solutions.txt`  and hand in that file.  
Clearly identify the individual tasks in that file.**  Make sure that only a single 
`mclient` is connected to the MonetDB database while you perform these tasks.


1. Use `EXPLAIN` on _Q1_ and inspect the resulting MAL program.

   - Provide
     _detailed comments for each line_ in the MAL program and briefly explain
     the _role of all BAT variables_ the program assigns to.  (You neither need
     to consider the initial commands leading up to the call to `sql.mvc()`
     nor the trailing `bat.append` and `language.pass` statements that
     lead up to the final `sql.resultSet` call.)
   - In particular, explain what the two following MAL operations compute and what
     role they play in the program for _Q1_:
     - `bat.mirror(`_b_`)`,
     - `algebra.intersect(`_b1_`,`_b2_`,nil:BAT,false,nil:lng)` &nbsp;&nbsp; (you may consider the
       last three arguments fixed).
   - Does MonetDB use _shortcut_ to implement SQL's `EXISTS` (see Task 2 of the
     assignment on the Volcano iterator model)?  Explain briefly.


SQL query _Q2_ refers to table `detail` only:

~~~sql
-- Query Q2
SELECT d.b AS b, d.a * 2 + d.a * 2 AS plus
FROM   detail AS d
WHERE  d.a * 2 > 15;
~~~

**YOUR TASKS:**

2. Use `EXPLAIN` on _Q2_ and inspect the resulting MAL program.

   - Find out whether MonetDB implements _common subexpression elimination_
     (CSE), _i.e._, are repeated subexpressions like `d.a * 2` only
     evaluated once?  Briefly explain your findings.
   - Does MonetDB implement CSE across the `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses?
   - If not, provide an improved MAL program that implements query _Q2_
     and computes the subexpression `d.a * 2` only _once_.

     To do that, complete the MAL program stub below and hand in the
     completed program.  If your program assigns to BAT variables,
     _always_ provide explicit type signatures as in `t:bat[:int] :=
     ‹MAL expression›;`.  **NB:** Before you hand in your MAL code, make
     sure that you have produced a program that indeed runs without
     error in an `mclient -l msql` session.

     ~~~plain
     # implements SQL query Q2 (using full CSE)
     sql := sql.mvc();

     ‹your MAL program here›

     io.print(‹BAT to represent result column b›, ‹BAT to represent result column plus›);
