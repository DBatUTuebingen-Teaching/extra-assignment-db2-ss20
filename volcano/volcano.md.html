(#) The Volcano Iterator Model [3 + 1 + 3 = 7 Points]

The _Volcano iterator model_ is a strategy to evaluate plan operators
in an on-demand fashion.  We can use SQL's _cursors_ to observe the
effects of this evaluation strategy at the SQL console.

To set the scene for this assignment, use the DDL and DML statements in
the provided file `volcano.sql` to create, populate, and analyze the
(by now well-known) tables `one(a,b,c)` and `many(a,b,c)` inside a
PostgreSQL database.

**YOUR TASKS:**

**Add all answers to one plain-text file `solutions.txt`  and hand in that file.  
Clearly identify the Tasks 1 to 3 in that file.**

1. Define SQL cursors over the results of the queries _Q1_ to _Q3_
   below. When you retrieve individual rows of these results via `FETCH`
   you will notice that these `FETCH` operations take different
   execution times to complete.  (Repeat each of the three experiments a
   few times until you are confident that you indeed observe recurring
   timing patterns. Once your recognize a pattern, there is no need to
   fetch further rows.) **For each of _Q1_ to _Q3_, report the observed
   `FETCH` times and briefly (but crisply) explain these timings
   based on the Volcano-style implementation of the queries' plan
   operators.**

   Use the following template for your timing experiments:

  ~~~sql
  -- Inspect plan operators for query
  EXPLAIN (VERBOSE, COSTS false)
    ‹query›;

  -- Cursors need a transaction context
  BEGIN;

  -- Declare SQL cursor for query result
  DECLARE pipeline SCROLL CURSOR FOR
    ‹query›;

  -- Fetch first rows of query result, row by row
  FETCH NEXT pipeline;    -- observe execution time for this FETCH
  FETCH NEXT pipeline;    -- observe execution time
    ⋮
    ‹repeat as needed›
    ⋮
  FETCH NEXT pipeline;    -- observe execution time

  -- Release cursor, close transaction
  CLOSE pipeline;
  COMMIT;
  ~~~

  SQL query _Q1_ (note that variable `:MANY` reflects the cardinality of the
  `many` table):

  ~~~sql
  -- Query Q1
  SELECT m.*
  FROM   many AS m
  OFFSET :MANY - 10;
  ~~~

  SQL query _Q2_:

  ~~~sql
  -- Query Q2
  SELECT o.a, m.*
  FROM   generate_series(2,4) AS o(a),
         LATERAL (SELECT m.*
                  FROM   many AS m
                  OFFSET :MANY - o.a) AS m;
  ~~~

  SQL query _Q3_:

  ~~~sql
  -- Query Q3
  SELECT m.c, SUM(m.a) AS agg
  FROM   many AS m
  GROUP BY m.c;
  ~~~

2. How can you tell _only from looking at the `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE,
   ANALYZE)` output_ for the two equivalent queries _Q4_ and _Q5_ below
   that PostgreSQL evaluates `EXISTS (`_Q_`)` using a _shortcut_
   (_i.e._, as soon as it is known that query _Q_ delivers a non-empty result,
   evaluation of `EXISTS` stops).  Point to those specific parts of the
   `EXPLAIN` outputs that give PostgreSQL's implementation strategy away
   (it may be helpful to contrast the two `EXPLAIN` outputs for _Q4_ and _Q5_).

   ~~~sql
   -- Query Q4
   SELECT EXISTS(TABLE many);

   -- Query Q5
   SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM many) > 0;
   ~~~

3. Provide pseudo-code (see Chapter 13, slides 13+14) for the three
   Volcano API methods `open`, `next`, `close` for each of the two plan operators
   below:

   - `Materialize(`_p_`)`: materializes result of plan _p_ in an in-memory buffer,
     then delivers rows from that buffer.
   - `Offset(`_n_`,`_p_`)`: delivers rows at offsets _n_, _n_+1, _n_+2, ...
       of the result of plan _p_.
