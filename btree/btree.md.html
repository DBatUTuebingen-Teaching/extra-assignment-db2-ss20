(#) Multi-Column B⁺Tree-Indices &nbsp;&nbsp; [1 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 = 8 Points]

This assignment is all about B⁺Trees over _multiple columns_ (_i.e._, index keys
are _composite_ or _concatenated_).  We specifically use two-column keys of
integers.  An example of such a B⁺Tree _T_ with _order_ _o_ = 2 is given in
Figure [initial] below.

**YOUR TASKS:**

1. **Insert** the key values `(8,8)` and `(85,54)` (in that order) into _T_.
   We assume that the insert operation does **not use redistribution**.

   Hand in one sketch of the B⁺Tree that results after both inserts have
   been performed. Add your sketch to the provided file
   `btree-sketches.md.html` which will render your character-based
   drawings nicely if viewed in a web browser (we have provided the
   initial tree _T_ in that file as a template that you can copy, paste,
   and then modify.)

2. **Delete** the key values `(91,61)`, `(10,10)`, `(14,16)` (in that order)
   from the tree that resulted from Task 1.  We assume that the delete
   operations **use merging and redistribution on all tree levels**.

   Add to file `btree-sketches.md.html` one sketch of the B⁺Tree that
   results after all three deletes have been performed.

[Figure [initial]: Initial B⁺Tree _T_ of order _o_ = 2.]

---

Use the provided SQL file `btree.sql` to create table
`playground(x,y)` in a PostgreSQL database.   Columns `x` (unique) and `y` (with
duplicates) both hold 8-byte integer values.  The SQL file populates
the table with 10^6 rows and finally creates a multi-column B⁺Tree index
`playground_x_y` using composite `(x,y)` keys.

**Note the following:**

- We assume PostgreSQL version&nbsp;12, just like in the lecture.
- The following tasks make use of the PostgreSQL `pageinspect` extension.
  Let us remind you of the following functions in that extension.  You will
  find sample uses of these in file `btree-indexes.sql` that we have distributed
  with the material of Chapter&nbsp;9 of the lecture:
  - `bt_metap(`_‹index name›_`)`,
  - `bt_page_stats(`_‹index name›_`,`_‹page number›_`)`,
  - `bt_page_items(`_‹index name›_`,`_‹page number›_`)`.
- PostgreSQL's catalog table `pg_class` may also prove helpful (again,
  see `btree-indexes.sql` of Chapter 9).


**YOUR TASKS:**

3. Construct a SQL query that computes the _height h_ of the B⁺Tree `playground_x_y`.

4. Construct a SQL query that computes _#pages_(`playground_x_y`), the _number of
   pages_ occupied by index `playground_x_y`.

5. Construct a SQL query that computes the _average fanout_ of all non-leaf
   nodes of index `playground_x_y`.

6. Construct a SQL query that computes the _average occupancy_ (_i.e._,
   % of page space used) of all leaf nodes of index `playground_x_y`.

**The above SQL queries all return single-row, single-column results.  Hand in
these four SQL queries (not their results) in a file `solutions.sql`.**

7. Some B⁺Tree implementations perform _suffix truncation_ if the index keys
   contain multiple columns: trailing columns of the index
   keys are not stored in the index entries provided that
   B⁺Tree search continues to work as required.

   - What is the benefit of such key suffix truncation?  Explain briefly.
   - Use index `playground_x_y` to find out whether PostgreSQL v12 implements
     such suffix truncation in
         - non-leaf index nodes, and/or
         - leaf index nodes.

**For each of the two index node kinds, add a SQL query to
`solutions.sql` whose result clearly demonstrates whether/how
PostgreSQL's B⁺Trees handle suffix truncation.  Provide a brief
explanation of how to interpret the two query outputs.** You may find
the auxiliary function `data_to_numeric` in SQL file `btree.sql`
helpful in this context.

8. Add a copy of the sketch of the initial B⁺Tree _T_ of Figure [initial]
   to file `btree-sketches.md.html` and modify its key entries such that
   your sketch properly reflects PostgreSQL's treatment of key suffix truncation.
