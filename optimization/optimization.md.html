(#) Query Optimization [4 + 3 = 7 Points]

(##) Cost Estimation of `Scan` Operators [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 Points]

Let us study the following SQL query _Q1_ over an instance of the TPC-H benchmark
(if you want to play along: we have provided directory `TPC-H/` which
contains everything to set up a TPC-H instance with scale factor _SF_ =
0.01 â€” you already know this instance from the lecture, Chapter 14):

~~~sql
-- Query Q1
SELECT o.o_clerk
FROM   orders AS o
WHERE  o.o_orderkey < 10000;
~~~

Table `orders` has a clustered primary key index `orders_pkey` defined
on column `o_orderkey`. The following cost model parameters are known
from PostgreSQL's configuration files and catalog tables:

| Cost Model Parameter         | Value        |
| ---------------------------- | -----------: |
| **Default Parameters**       |              |
| `seq_page_cost`              | `1.0`        |
| `random_page_cost`           | `4.0`        |
| `cpu_tuple_cost`             | `0.01`       |
| `cpu_index_tuple_cost`       | `0.005`      |
| `cpu_operator_cost`          | `0.0025`     |
| **Table `orders`**           |              |
| `#rows(orders)`              | `15000`      |
| `#pages(orders)`             | `261`        |
| **Index `orders_pkey`**      |              |
| `h(orders_pkey)`             | `1`          |
| `#rows(orders_pkey)`         | `15000`      |
| `#pages(orders_pkey)`        | `43`         |
| `corr(orders_pkey)`          | `1.0`        |
| **Selectivities**            |              |
| `sel(o_orderkey > 10000)`    | `0.83313`    |
| `sel(o_orderkey < 10000)`    | `0.16680`    |

**YOUR TASKS:**

**Add all answers to one plain-text file `solutions.txt` and hand in that file.  
Clearly identify the Tasks 1 to 6 in that file.  Make sure that we can follow 
exactly how you derived cost estimates or developed cost formulae.**

1.  Calculate the *estimated cost* (`startup_cost` and `total_cost`) for the following two
    query plans, based on the cost model parameters given above.  Compare your results and identify
    the better plan.

    ~~~none
                    QUERY PLAN 1                    |                      QUERY PLAN 2
    ------------------------------------------      |      ------------------------------------------
     Seq Scan on orders o                           |       Index Scan using orders_pkey on orders o
       Output: o_clerk                              |         Output: o_clerk
       Filter: (o.o_orderkey < 10000)               |         Index Cond: (o.o_orderkey < 10000)
    ~~~

2.  Cost estimation strongly depends on the selectivity of the filter predicate `sel(o_orderkey < 10000)`.
    If we evaluate _Q1_ with a different predicate, the system's preference for `Seq Scan` or
    `Index Scan` may change.  Re-calculate the *estimated cost* for _Q1_ with the modified
    predicate `o.o_orderkey > 10000` (note: `>` instead of `<`) and identify the better plan.

    ~~~none
                    QUERY PLAN 3                    |                      QUERY PLAN 4
    ------------------------------------------      |      ------------------------------------------
     Seq Scan on orders o                           |       Index Scan using orders_pkey on orders o
       Output: o_clerk                              |         Output: o_clerk
       Filter: (o.o_orderkey > 10000)               |         Index Cond: (o.o_orderkey > 10000)
    ~~~

3.  Generalization: Assume query _Q1_ uses an index-supported predicate _p_ on column `o_orderkey`.
    Cost model parameters remain as given above.

      - What is the _maximum selectivity_ _s_ = `sel`(_p_`)` for which the _estimated cost_ of
        plan operator `Index Scan` does
        not exceed the _estimated cost_ of `Seq Scan`?
      - What is the _cardinality_ _c_ (_i.e._, number of output rows) of _Q1_ for this
        selectivity _s_?

4.  Cost model parameter change: Now assume that the system that hosts the TPC-H instance
    is exclusively equipped with solid-state drives (SSDs) instead of mechanical HDDs.

      - Which cost model parameter would you change (and how)? Explain briefly.
      - Repeat your computation of Task 3 with this new parameter setting.  What
        are the new values of selectivity _s_ and cardinality _c_? Is that change
        reasonable?  Explain briefly.

(##) Cost Estimation of `Nested Loop` Joins [2 + 1 = 3 Points]

Let us now turn to the following PostgreSQL query plan (created with `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)`).
The plan refers to tables `one(a,b,c)` and `many(a,b,c)` as they are created and populated by the provided
SQL file `optimization.sql`.

~~~none
                                QUERY PLAN 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=???..??? rows=#rows(out) width=4)
   Output: (m.c - o.c)
   Join Filter: (m.c > o.c)
   ->  Seq Scan on public.one o  (cost=startup_cost(outer)..total_cost(outer) rows=#rows(outer) width=4)
         Output: o.a, o.b, o.c
   ->  Seq Scan on public.many m  (cost=startup_cost(inner)..total_cost(inner) rows=#rows(inner) width=4)
         Output: m.a, m.b, m.c
~~~

To fill in the missing cost estimates `???..???` above, we need a cost model
for `Nested Loop` Joins.

5.  Propose cost estimation formulae that derive `startup_cost` and
    `total_cost` for simple `Nested Loop` Joins (NLJ) and hand in your
    formulae. Stick to the formula notation used in the lectures on
    slide 22 of Chapter 14 (Query Optimization). Your formulae have to
    take into account
      - the estimated cost of the two joined inputs (_outer_ and _inner_),
      - the evaluation of the `Join Filter` predicate (_pred_) and
      - the evaluation of the `Output` expression (_expr_).

6.  Compare your results with PostgreSQL's built-in cost estimation for `Nested Loop` Joins:
      - Construct a SQL query _Q2_ on tables `one` and `many` which
        results in a query plan _P_ matching `QUERY PLAN 5` above.
        **Note:** You may have to set `enable_material=off` or change other configuration parameters
                  to enforce such a plan.
        Hand in your query _Q2_ and the resulting plan _P_.

      - Based on the numbers given in plan _P_, calculate the _estimated costs_ according to your
        formula developed in Task 5.  Compare your results with the cost estimated by PostgreSQL and
        discuss briefly.
